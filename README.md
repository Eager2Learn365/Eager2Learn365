## Hi there, my name is Abdo - aka Eager2Learn365 and Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate software developer with a knack for crafting innovative solutions that drive results. Recently graduated with a computer science degree and limited experience in the industry, I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, from mobile apps to enterprise software, and everything in between. My expertise spans Python, Java, C++, F+ and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow.

What drives me 

As a software developer, I'm obsessed with creating high-quality code that is both efficient and scalable. I thrive in fast-paced environments where no two days are ever the same, and I relish the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams to bring ideas to life.
